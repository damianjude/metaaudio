## Known Issues

- **Misrecognition by Shazam**:\
  Occasionally, Shazam may incorrectly identify a song, resulting in wrong metadata (such as title or artwork).\
  This is a limitation of the Shazam service itself, not MetaAudio.\
  For such cases, use the `removemetadata.py` tool to clear incorrect tags.
